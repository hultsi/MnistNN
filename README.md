# Works to a fairly good extent now

The neural network interface isn't really generalized but worked for this purpose. A more generalized version of a neural network class implementation can be found from my mnist GAN repo.

## NN live here:

### update: tensorflow model added to front end as well

### update2: The link might stop working any day as I'm not paying for the server anymore
